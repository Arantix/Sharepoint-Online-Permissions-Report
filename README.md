# Sharepoint-Online-Permissions-Report
Hi,
those three functions will allow you to create PSObjects from permissions on your Sharepoint Online site contents.
Please check synopsis of funtions to help you getting started with functions.

Some of the permissions which points to secrurity group are in form of AzureAD ID that is why I've created this little function:
Resolve-SPOLoginName
It connectects you your AzureAD and resolved ID to display name.
